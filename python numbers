this just goes over the basic data types
Ex: x = 1234543 
this would be a int or integer data type no matter if it was a negative number or not what matters is that it is a whole number
A whole number is what makes a integer
A float or floating point number is a positive or negative number containing one or more decimals
Numbers with an e indicate the power of 10 for a float
Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part
